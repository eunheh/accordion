#jQuery and CSS Transitions

##New concepts were added to our library of coding knowledge and were implemented on the accordion exercise. Here are some highlights of the topic we went over today.

1. jQuery
  * a JavaScript library that enhances the functions we can write on JavaScript
  * "$" is what is used to "call/use" the JQuery function
  * $("class"); allows us to call on specific arguments inside the $(" ")
  * IMPORTANT NOTE: jQuery gives back an array

2. CSS Transitions
  * a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties

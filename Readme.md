#jQuery and CSS Transitions were added to our library of coding knowledge and implemented them the accordion exercise. Here are some highlights of the topic we went over today.

1. jQuery
  * a JavaScript library that enhances the functions we can write on JavaScript
  * "$" is what is used to "call/use" the JQuery function
  * $("class"); allows us to call on specific arguments inside the $(" ")
  * IMPORTANT NOTE: jQuery gives back an array

2. CSS Transitions
  * a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties
